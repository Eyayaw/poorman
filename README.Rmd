## Goal

The goal of `poorman` is to provide base R versions of `dplyr` functions. Check out the blog posts [here](https://nathaneastwood.github.io/tags/poorman/) for more details.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/nathaneastwood/poorman) with:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nathaneastwood/poorman")
```

Or you can download the latest release from CRAN with:

```{r cran, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("poorman")
```

## Features

`poorman` attempts to replicate the `dplyr` API exactly such that your dplyr code will still run even if you use `poorman` in its place, it even comes with its own `magrittr` pipe (`%>%`) replica. Below are some of the operations that are currently available.

```{r libraries}
library(poorman)
```

### `select()`

```{r select}
mtcars %>% select(mpg, gear, disp)
```

### `filter()`

```{r filter}
mtcars %>% filter(mpg > 28)
```

### `mutate()`

```{r mutate}
mtcars %>% mutate(mpg2 = mpg ^ 2)
```

### `arrange()`

```{r arrange}
mtcars %>% arrange(mpg)
```

### `group_by()`

```{r group_by}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(am, cyl) %>%
  summarise(meanMpg = mean(mpg), sumMpg = sum(mpg)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

## Related Work

* [`bplyr`](https://github.com/yonicd/bplyr) - imports `magrittr` and `rlang`; it prepends functions with `b_*()`, e.g. `b_select()`.
* [`tbltools`](https://github.com/mkearney/tbltools) - imports `magrittr` and appends `*_data()` to each of its functions, e.g. `select_data()`.
